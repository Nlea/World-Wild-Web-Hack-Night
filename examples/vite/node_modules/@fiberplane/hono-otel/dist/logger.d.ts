/**
 * Get a logger that can be used to log messages to the console.
 * - Optionally log depending on the FPX_LOG_LEVEL environment variable.
 * - By default, log everything when in development mode, and log "warn" and above otherwise.
 *
 * @OPTIMIZE - This creates a new logger every time it's called.
 *             (But this is somewhat necessary, because the logger needs to be able to access the environment variables.
 *              In CF Workers, the environment variables are only available at runtime,
 *              and a single worker's env might get reused across requests.)
 *
 * @param honoEnv - The environment variables from the Hono app.
 * @returns A logger object with methods for each log level
