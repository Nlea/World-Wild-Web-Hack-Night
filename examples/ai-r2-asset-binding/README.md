## ðŸª¿ AI- R2 - ASSET Binding example

This is a project created with the `create-honc-app` template.

It uses Neon as a database. This example outlines Cloudflare's AI, R2 and Asset binding. 

### AI Binding

The AI binding is defined in the `wrangler.toml` file. In the application, the `/api/ai` endpoint uses a text-to-text LLM (Large Language Model) to generate responses.

The endpoint receives a message and uses it as a prompt for the LLM. The model then returns a response:

```typescript
app.post("/api/ai", async (c) => {
  const { message } = await c.req.json();
  const messages = [
    { role: "system", content: "You are a friendly assistant" },
    {
      role: "user",
      content: message,
    },
  ];
  const response = await c.env.AI.run(
    "@cf/meta/llama-3.3-70b-instruct-fp8-fast",
    { messages }
  );
  return c.json(response);
});
```
Cloudflare provides a [variety of models](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/models/) that you can use with the AI binding.

### Asset Binding

The asset binding and entry point are defined in the `wrangler.toml`:

```
[assets]
directory = "public"
```
An `index.html` file in the `public` folder is served when the application starts.


### R2 Bucket
The R2 bucket provides object storage. When running Cloudflare locally, the bucket is simulated on your machine.

To deploy the project, you'll need to enable billing in your Cloudflare account and ensure the bucket exists on the Cloudflare network. You can create a bucket by running:

```
npx wrangler r2 bucket create <YOUR_BUCKET_NAME>
```

### Getting started

Make sure you have Neon set up and configured with your database. Create a .dev.vars file with the `DATABASE_URL` key and value (see: `.dev.vars.example`).

### Project structure

```#
â”œâ”€â”€ src
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ index.ts # Hono app entry point
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ db
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ schema.ts # Database schema
â”œâ”€â”€ seed.ts # Optional seeding script
â”œâ”€â”€ .dev.vars.example # Example .dev.vars file
â”œâ”€â”€ wrangler.toml # Cloudflare Workers configuration
â”œâ”€â”€ drizzle.config.ts # Drizzle configuration
â”œâ”€â”€ tsconfig.json # TypeScript configuration
â””â”€â”€ package.json
```

### Commands

Run the migrations and (optionally) seed the database:

```sh
# this is a convenience script that runs db:generate, db:migrate, and db:seed
npm run db:setup
```

Run the development server:

```sh
npm run dev
```

### Developing

When you iterate on the database schema, you'll need to generate a new migration and apply it:

```sh
npm run db:generate
npm run db:migrate
```

### Deploying

Set your `DATABASE_URL` secret (and any other secrets you need) with wrangler:

```sh
npx wrangler secret put DATABASE_URL
```

Finally, change the name of the project in `wrangler.toml` to something appropriate for your project

```toml
name = "my-neon-project"
```

Deploy with wrangler:

```sh
npm run deploy
```
