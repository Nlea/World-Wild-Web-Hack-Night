# World Wild Web Hack Night
Hey, 
thanks for joining us for WWW Night! In this repo you'll find all the information you need to get started with the hack night. 

## Prerequisites
* Bring your own laptop
* Have Node.js and a JS package manager installed
* [A Cloudflare account](https://dash.cloudflare.com/login/) 

## The Challenge
### Requirements
- Build any application using [HONC](https://honc.dev/): `npm create honc-app@latest`
- Include at least one [Cloudflare Binding](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/bindings/)

> ðŸ’¡ Tip: Honc already comes with a D1 Database binding

### Examples and Inspiration
- This repo contains a folder with the example shown in the intro and an example using Cloudflare's vite plugin and react
- [Official Honc Examples](https://github.com/fiberplane/create-honc-app/tree/main/examples)
- [Awesome Honc list](https://github.com/fiberplane/awesome-honc)


## Evaluation criteria
- Extra points for deployed apps
- Live demos are preferred over presentation slides
- Nothing to demo? Don't worry - you can also share your code and learnings from the evening. We have a special learning award!

## Submission
If you'd like to present, fill out [this form](https://forms.gle/qKFmVuMTnJqqS5qeA)

Every group that wants to present will join a Google Call. This way we don't have to switch computers. 

We will share the Google Call invite with you closer to the end of the event.
